# Credit Scoring with Machine Learning Models

# Overview:
This project utilizes the "Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset" sourced from Kaggle to develop a credit scoring model. The aim is to predict the likelihood of default on credit card payments based on various features provided in the dataset. This prediction is crucial for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of clients and manage credit risk effectively.

# Dataset:
The dataset contains information about credit card clients, including demographic attributes, credit history, payment details, and default status. It includes features such as age, gender, education, marital status, repayment status, bill amounts, and payment amounts. The target variable is whether the client defaulted on the credit card payment or not.

# Models:
Several machine learning models are explored for credit scoring:

Chameleon Swarm Backpropagation Networks (CSBPN): CSBPN is a hybrid neural network algorithm that combines swarm intelligence with backpropagation for enhanced performance in classification tasks.

Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective linear model for binary classification tasks. It estimates the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.

Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

Gradient Boosting Classifier: Gradient Boosting is a boosting ensemble algorithm that builds a strong model by sequentially adding weak learners (decision trees) and adjusting the weights of training instances based on the errors of the previous predictions.

# Implementation:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. Additionally, feature selection techniques may be applied to identify relevant features for the models.

Model Training: The preprocessed data is used to train each machine learning model. During training, the models learn to predict the probability of credit card default based on the input features.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess their performance in predicting credit card defaults. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure the robustness of the models.

Deployment: Once the models achieve satisfactory performance, they can be deployed in a real-world setting to assist financial institutions in assessing credit risk and making informed lending decisions.
